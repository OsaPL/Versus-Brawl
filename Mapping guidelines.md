# Mappipng guideline
These are general guidelines that will make the map more enjoyable and less janky, for this mod.
All of them have been created from play test games

## Navigation
1. Take into account that `jump nav point` will be used regardles of species, so make it jumpable even for slowest ones.

## Performance
1. Keep levels light on decorations, splitscreen increase load by a lot.
2. Many effects are not even rendering for splitscreen (like fire effects), so removing them an give you a fps boost.

## General tips 
1. Try not put high or far ledges only available for rabbits, not everyone jumps that high and far.
Instead create for example, a row of columns, allowing rabbits to shine, but other species to still be viable (especially fast ones)
2. Do not to create one way battlegrounds, always give another way, holding a choke with a weapon is pretty easy
Single rooms with a single way in and out turns int
3. Weapons should be available to the all players similarly, even the playing field
4. Spawns should be pretty close, for that quick, swift action.
5. ... dont put them right next to each other tho
6. Spruce the level with some small obstacles, killzones, spikes, lava pits, whatever can be used to "accidently" trip into (with or without help of your enemies)
