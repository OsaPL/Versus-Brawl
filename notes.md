### Some balancing notes:
Wolf shouldnt be able to one hit kill dog

wolf is weak vs weapons

cat is glass cannon, good vs lower hp rabbit and rat

rat is great for pushing opponents

### Playtesting sessions notes:

- session #1 (mostly blocks, 3 players) 11 Oct

wolf is in a surprisingly good place, maybe make attack or movement speed slightly higher?

rat is kinda annoying on maps with hazards, good, tis the way of the rat

cats feel weak, even with high movements and attack speeds, buff them a little?

rabbits feel now better that default, maybe even a slight dmg nerf is needed still

nobody played dog, other than to counter wolf, maybe hes too weak against other species? maybe he feels sluggish and underpowered when comparing to wolf?

- session #2 (cave, block and planks, 4 players) 23 Oct

rock a little to easy to camp on  => longer respawn, shorter active time (done)

wolf a little to hard to kill? =? decrease slightly attack speed and resistance (done)

wolf op on planks => maybe allow species to be blocked per map?

cave - swap healing with rock, and make the rock powerup place more hostile (more ways to die)

planks - you can get on top of the tower things => lower planks (done)
