# Versus-Brawl
## THE Overgrowth Versus mode overhaul
I had a dream mod I wanted to make 6 yrs ago, and I didnt really try to make it. I've done a basic 4 player mod, and called it a day.

After dusting it off, and having a complete blast with my buddies, I decided now is the time.

No more wonky scripts, no more boring maps, no more rabbits (<sub>okay few rabbits can stay</sub>), no more maps that are hard to create.

I say, slash, bonk, impale and do whatever else you want to do with your friends (<sub>ew, not that, gross</sub>).

*Pro tip: I really recommend using Steams Remote Play Together.*

# Quick disclaimer:
There are things missing atm:
- No respawn system is not yet completed
- No ability to team up
- No modifications to the default character scripts
- No generic gamemode interface
- No events/hotspots for new gamemodes implementation

Some of the functionality will come eventually, once I have laid the foundation by developing these features.
Anything marked by ðŸ‘» is missing atm.

# Fixed/Reworked
- 2/3/4 player support, with UI help and gamepad support
- Players should no longer get their Id swapped, resulting in gamepads being always correctly arranged
- Two maps that arent just a gm_flatgrass (ðŸ‘»6 planned, atleast 1 per mode)
- Only a single level script and few basic prefabs needed to create a map. You can have a map ready in matter of minutes.
- Ability to change race on respawn, with each race having diffrent stats and a unique trait
- Warmup before the rounds start
- `F8` now does a hard-reload of the map (this saved me EONS of time)
- ðŸ‘»SuperEasy<sup>TM</sup> to extend with new races (mostly true, but there are still few hardcoded places)
- ðŸ‘»Randomized character apperance (almost completely done, missing some variants)
- ðŸ‘»Easy to extend with new gamemodes
- ðŸ‘»NPC opponents support (this will rely on map maker to implement detailed paths)

# Gamemodes:

- Versus fight
  
Last bun standing gets the point

- ðŸ‘»Race
  
*self explanatory*

- ðŸ‘»Sacrifice 
  
each body thrown to your abbys, gives a point

- ðŸ‘»Capture the fur 
  
basically capture the flag

# Species:
*These are subject to change*

# Small bugs (dont report these, I know :) )
- player one can sometimes change species on selecting number of players
- clothing colors may look wonky, low priority
- changing anything in the script, causes ui to bug out (my fault, probably global script variables are being cleared)
- for 2 players the UI still stays the same as for 3/4 players setup
- most of the UI stuff is filled with placeholders atm
