# Versus-Brawl
## THE Overgrowth Versus mode overhaul

# Quick disclaimer:
There are things missing atm:
- No respawn handling
- No ability to team up
- No modifications to the default character scripts

Some of the functionality will come eventually, once I have laid the foundation by developing these features.
Anything marked by ðŸ‘» is missing atm.

# Fixed/Reworked
- 2/3/4 player support, with UI help and gamepad support
- Only a single level script and basic prefabs needed to create a map. You can have a map ready in matter of minutes.
- Ability to change race on respawn
- ðŸ‘»SuperEasy to extend with new races (mostly true, but there are still few hardcoded places)
- ðŸ‘»Warmup round for setup (ok this kinda works, but no respawning)
- ðŸ‘»Randomized character apperance (almost completely done, missing some variants)
- ðŸ‘»Easy to extend with new gamemodes

# Gamemodes:

- Versus fight
  
Last bun standing gets the point

- ðŸ‘»Race
  
*self explanatory*

- ðŸ‘»Abduction 
  
each body thrown to your abbys, gives a point

- ðŸ‘»Capture the fur 
  
basically capture the flag

# Species:
