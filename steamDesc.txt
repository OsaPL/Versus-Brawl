[h2]THE Overgrowth Versus mode overhaul[/h2]
I had a dream mod I wanted to make 6 yrs ago, and I didnt really try to make it. I’ve done a basic [url=https://forums.wolfire.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=40260&p=245753&hilit=4+players#p245753]4 player mod[/url], and called it a day.

After dusting it off, and having a complete blast with my buddies, I decided now is the time.

No more wonky scripts, no more boring maps, no more rabbits (<sub>okay few rabbits can stay</sub>), no more maps that are hard to create.

I say, slash, bonk, impale and do whatever else you want to do with your friends (<sub>ew, not that, gross</sub>).

[i]Pro tip: I really recommend using Steams Remote Play Together.[/i]

[h1]Quick disclaimer:[/h1]
There are things missing atm:
[list]
[*]Respawn system is not yet completed (still a little wonky, missing a more generic spawn code)
[*]No ability to team up
[*]No big modifications to the default character scripts
[*]Missing elements for new gamemodes implementation
[/list]

Some of the functionality will come eventually, once I have laid the foundation by developing these features.
[b]Anything marked by 👻 is missing atm.[/b]

[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*]2/3/4 player support, with UI help and gamepad support
[*]Play Coop on any level (👻custom levels support missing)
[*]Ability to change species, with each character having different stats and a unique trait
[*]Players should no longer get their Id swapped, resulting in gamepads being always correctly arranged
[*]New maps that arent just a gm_flatgrass, designed for game modes (👻6 planned, atleast 1 per mode)
[*]Only a single level script and few basic prefabs needed to create a map. You can have a map ready in matter of minutes.
[*]Warmup before the game start (with preloading for smoother gameplay)
[*]Easy to extend with new gamemodes (with even more options coming)
[*]👻Pickup wacky powerups and be able to add your own with only few lines of code (need to create a template for external use)
[*]👻SuperEasy<sup>TM</sup> to extend with new races (mostly true, but there are still few hardcoded places)
[*]👻Randomized character apperance (almost completely done, missing some variants, colors look whack sometimes)
[*]👻NPC opponents support (this will rely on map maker to implement detailed paths)
[/list]

[h1]FAQ[/h1]

[olist]
[*][b]How do I swap characters?[/b]
[/olist]

For each player its always [b]drop[/b] and [b]item[/b] key together, then press [b]attack[/b] to switch to next.
The UI should start showing you different species icons, if its not the gamemode doesnt allow it. 
Some gamemodes only allow for next round change while game is in progress.

[olist]
[*][b]How do I select amount of players?[/b]
[/olist]

Go to the [b]Settings -> Game -> Local Players[/b]. If you’re already on a level, you’ll need to go back to the main menu and load the map again (or do a full map reload [b]F10[/b] where supported).

[olist]
[*][b]How do I enable coop on a level?[/b]
[/olist]

Just set [b]Local Players[/b] and launch a level.
Not all custom levels are supported atm. Please, dont message me if its incompatible, you should let the mapper know. 
[url=https://github.com/OsaPL/Versus-Brawl/blob/main/Adding%20maps%20and%20gamemodes%20README.md]There is a helpful README for modders/mappers.[/url]

For already coop supported old levels, set [b]Local Players[/b] to [b]1[/b] for compatibility.

[olist]
[*][b]What does <action here> key correspond to?[/b]
[/olist]

For an XbOne gamepad its: 

[b]item[/b] A
[b]drop[/b] X
[b]attack[/b] right trigger
[b]grab[/b] left trigger
[b]crouch[/b] right bumper
[b]jump[/b] left bumper
[b]skip_dialogue[/b] start

If you have other any gamepad, you’re smart, I believe you’ll figure it out.

[olist]
[*][b]Gamepads not working/controlling one character/other stupid controller related bugs[/b]
[/olist]

Make sure your gamepads are all connected before starting the map. If problem persists, try restarting the game. If the problem still occurs, try reassigning gamepads.

[olist]
[*][b]The game sometimes crashes on spawning characters[/b]
[/olist]

Unfortunately, it looks like spawning in new characters and then setting [b]SetPlayer(true)[/b] is sometimes unstable, probably correlated with input/controller_id. Can’t do much about it rn.

[h1]Species:[/h1]
[i]These are subject to change[/i]

[i]I appreciate any balancing feedback![/i]

[h3]Rabbits:[/h3]
Pretty agile, king of horizontal movement.
[b]Trait[/b]: Rabbit binkies - Midair powerful attack

[h3]Dogs:[/h3]
Tanky and hard hitting.
[b]Trait[/b]: Now you catch! - throws weapons much harder

[h3]Cats:[/h3]
Agile and fast but fragile.
[b]Trait[/b]: Always lands on its feet - No dmg from falls, catches weapons automatically

Really fast, kings of vertical spaces.
[b]Trait[/b]: Cant be stomped - knockout shield

[h3]Wolf:[/h3]:
Slow but powerful.
[b]Trait[/b]: Pounces on you - sharp claws, cant use weapons (still can defend by grabbing incoming ones)

[h1]Powerups[/h1]
[list][*][b]Ninja[/b] (dark smoke) - Have an infinite supply of knives to throw (hands must be free)
[*][b]Heal[/b] (green poof) - Heals all damage
[*][b]Rock[/b] (blue sparks) - Gives high damage resistance
[*][b]Yeet[/b] (yellow dots) - Next direct hit (expires after [b]activeTime[/b]) will launch enemy really hard
[/list]
[h1]Small bugs ( dont report these, I know :) )[/h1]
[list][*]Coop partners sometimes bug out under the ground/behind walls whenever its cramped
[*]for 2 players the UI still stays the same as for 3/4 players setup
[*]for [b]constantRespawning[/b] spawning can lockup, cause you died in the 0.5s window window (needs a rework to the spawn guard [b]respawnBlockTime[/b] thingy, maybe just make char invincible for that window?)
[*]most of the UI stuff is filled with placeholders atm
[*]maps stutters after load (preloading is done after level load since [b]AssetManager[/b] is not available in [b]as_context[/b])
[*]clothing colors may look wonky, low priority
[*]map will reload on a script reload (helps me to keep everything synced up, without just tracking everything at all times)
[*]UI gets wonky on weird resolutions
